As of December 2025, job openings totaled 6.5 million while unemployed persons were 7.5 million, a gap of nearly one million—a notable shift from the earlier “worker shortage” era, in the wake of the recent pandemic. 2 The same report shows hires and total separations were roughly 5.3 million each, which is consistent with a “freeze” dynamic in the labor market rather than expansion. 2 [...] That stronger headline arrives after a softer finish to last year. In December, the U.S. economy added 48,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate sat at 4.4%, reflecting slower momentum than earlier in 2025. 1 January’s improvement helps reinforce that the labor market is still moving forward, even if the pace remains uneven.\\n\\n## A positive surprise, but revisions are the bigger story\\n\\nThe more important development may be what changed behind the scenes. Our analysis notes that while January’s 130,000 gain was encouraging, the BLS revisions imply 2025 average monthly job gains were revised down to about 15,000, a sharp step down from 2024’s 122,000 average monthly pace.  1 That contrast highlights why investors may see the labor market as stable today but less predictable looking ahead. [...] Bill Merz, head of capital markets research, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group\\n\\nRecent readings still look consistent with that idea, even if week to week numbers move around. In the week ending February 6, non-seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims fell slightly to 248,000 below average levels starting the past 3 years. 3 Meanwhile, layoffs increased in January according to Challenger, Grey and Christmas, but the three-month total of 215,000 is in line with the 26-year average. 4 That combination points to a labor market that is cooling more through slower hiring and fewer openings than through widespread job cuts.\\n\\nChart depicts initial jobless claims 2019-2026 as of January 30, 2026.\\n\\n## What a cooling labor market could mean for interest rates',\n",

However, the changing composition of those unemployed workers indicated economic weakness, as the percentage of unemployed workers that suffered temporary or permanent job loss rose from 45.2% in October to 46.4% in November. This trend was partly driven by substantial layoffs in the tech sector, which totaled more than 51,000 in November after averaging less than 7,000 per month throughout the pandemic. [...] Still, some other major backward-looking economic metrics fared well. The economy added 263,000 jobs, surpassing the 200,000 additions projected by economists. Leisure and Hospitality and Healthcare and Social Assistance registered the largest job gains this month, adding 88,000 and 68,000 new jobs, respectively.

The Kansas City, Missouri, resident is part of the growing share of Americans who are not only unemployed but have been looking for work for six months or more, making them what the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as \"long-term unemployed.\"\\n\\nOfficial numbers about the job market show a relatively stable labor economy with stronger than expected job growth in January — more than half of jobs added were in health care — and a slight drop in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, or 7.4 million people.

Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\n",
